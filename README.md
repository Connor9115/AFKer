## Dependencies
### .ahk
+ Auto Hot Key (AHK)

## .exe or .ahk?
+ If you don't have AHK v1.1 installed (or don't know if it's installed)
    + Download the .exe + OTA.ahk
+ If you have AHK installed
    + Download either + OTA.ahk (AFKer.ahk is recommended if you want to edit it yourself)

## Windows SmartScreen/Anti-virus intervention
This app is not verified by Microsoft thus SmartScreen picks it up. As for AVs, that's down to AHK itself, all AHK scripts are flagged. If either of these things make you feel too uncomfortable feel free to read over my code or use another AFK script/auto-clicker (or better yet, make your own!)
